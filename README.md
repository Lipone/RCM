# RCM:
The code of Reservior cross mapping (RCM).
We propose a causal detection method named Reservoir Cross Mapping (RCM), which integrates
RC with MCM to address the limitations of MCM. RCM provides a nonlinear approach to causality
detection without the need for pre-selecting phase space parameters. It takes time series of different
variables as input into distinct reservoirs to reconstruct the manifolds, subsequently predicting
causal relationships and quantifying causal strength by evaluating the smoothness of the mapping
between the reservoirs.

# Usage:
All code can be run in matlab
